# HP 15-fc0000 - Sequoia
HP Laptop 15-fc0000 series EFI - Created with Dortania's OpenCore Install Guide

**Processor:** Ryzen 7 7730U (This would probably work with [other processors HP produces the laptop with](https://support.hp.com/us-en/document/ish_7412013-7412050-16)).

### Note
I included a censored `config.plist` file named `censored_config.plist`. You will have to rename it and add your own MLB, ROM, SystemSerialNumber and SystemUUID, use [this guide](https://dortania.github.io/OpenCore-Install-Guide/AMD/zen.html#platforminfo) for doing so, I personally used `MacBookPro16,3` but it can be different depending on the processor.
