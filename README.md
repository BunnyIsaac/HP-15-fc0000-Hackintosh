# HP 15-fc0000 - Sequoia
HP Laptop 15-fc0000 series EFI - Created with Dortania's OpenCore Install Guide

**Processor:** Ryzen 7 7730U (This would probably work with [other processors HP produces the laptop with](https://support.hp.com/us-en/document/ish_7412013-7412050-16)).

### Note
I included a censored `config.plist` file named `censored-config.plist`. You will have to rename it and add your own MLB, ROM, SystemSerialNumber and SystemUUID.
